# Random Sport Tech Tests

Here you can review my tech test

## Getting Started

To handle the 3 exercice with reusable code, I choose to use dependency injection.

### Installing

This is a classic web service.

To lauch the server

```
yarn start
```

And repeat

```
curl http://localhost:4000/players
curl http://localhost:4000/players/17
curl http://localhost:4000/players/52

```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

### Enabling exercice 3

Uncomment line 8 to 11, then comment line 14 to 15 in file `./services/index.js`

## Running the tests

The unit tests are written written with JEST, to execute it :

```
yarn test
```
